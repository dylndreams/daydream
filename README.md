# Daydream

A W.I.P fantasy console that aims to be like the PS1 and Dreamcast.
Currently all I have is a hello world and it will probably be 2D capable at first.

The library I'm using is called [kit](https://github.com/rxi/kit) and utilizing
the SDL fork. I have modified it for audio and colors, and I might add some
more.

## TODO
* GPU/something like the GTE
* Memory
* SPU
* prety much everything a fantasy console has to provide
